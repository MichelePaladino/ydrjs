> Flashcards to memorize topics about Javascript, React, Redux, CSS and HTML

Why "You Don't Remember JavaScript"?

The title is a wordplay on the famous book series "You don't know JavaScript" written by Kyle Simpson.
I wanted to gather useful informations about topics often discussed during the interview process and present them in a elegant way.

Also, I practiced my React and CSS, and generally all that I learned during the last 18 months. 

## The Process

* Deployed a **single-page application** (SPA) that allows users to memorize topics about Javascript, React, Redux, CSS and HTML
* Designed flashcards using **CSS**, **Flexbox** and **CSS Grids**
* Crafted reusable components with **React** following **Atomic Design** and using **one-way data flow** to manage the state
* Developed a **RESTful API** to allow users to search/add/remove notes about their learning process
* Implemented a **NodeJS backend** to serve flashcards based on user input, such as choice of language and level of difficulty
* Utilized **local storage** database to persist data between sessions
* Applied a JavaScript implementation of the Durstenfeld shuffle, a computer-optimized version of the **Fisher-Yates shuffle    algorithm**, to randomize the flashcards
